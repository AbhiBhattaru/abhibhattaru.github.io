		<h1 id = "lin">President Lincoln</h1>
		<p >
		Why? In the 21st Century why should we honor Abraham Lincoln? The easy answer is Abraham Lincoln “Saved the Union” and “Freed the Slaves.” But what did that really entail? For Lincoln “Saving the Union” and “Freeing the Slaves” were linked together; “The Union must be preserved in the purity of its principles as well as the integrity of its territorial parts” he once proclaimed. One historian has explained the link between Union and Principles in a story similar to this: Lincoln thought of the United States as a train, a train with 34 cars [there were 34 states in the Union when Lincoln was inaugurated]. If the train was pulled apart, if some of the cars tried to leave the train the cars would overturn losing their cargo. For Lincoln the “cargo” the Union carried was the Principles of the Declaration of Independence: The principles of democracy, liberty, and equality. So in saving the Union Lincoln felt he was saving the Principles of the Declaration of Independence for his generation and for future generations. Lincoln knew that in his time true democracy did not exist in the United States because not every citizen could vote. The nearly four million slaves certainly didn’t have liberty. And not all, including women, had equality of opportunity. But Lincoln felt that if the Union was preserved eventually improvements would be made so that all citizens could vote, all people would enjoy liberty and opportunity. This is reflected in this Lincoln sentiment, “I say in relation to the principle that all men are created equal, let it be nearly reached as we can.”

		What? What should we remember about Abraham Lincoln? We should remember Abraham Lincoln’s deeds and words. President Lincoln could have chosen to allow the original seven seceding states to leave the Union. Or he could have compromised and allowed slavery to expand to some or all of the western states or even the whole United Sates so the seven states would change their mind about secession. He could have retracted his statement that slavery was morally wrong and should be put on a course of ultimate extinction, therefore, removing, the statement that insulted so many in the seceding states. He didn’t have to call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the insurrection after Fort Sumter was fired upon. He could have continued to fight the Civil War without issuing the Emancipation Proclamation. He could have, as many recommend, rescinded the Emancipation Proclamation when the War was going poorly for the United Sates of America. He could have agreed to an end of the Civil War leaving the slaves in bondage. He didn’t have to use all the might of office of President to influence Congressman to pass the 13th Amendment to the Constitution outlawing slavery. In each of these situations Abraham Lincoln had a choice; Lincoln always chose saving the union with the purity of its principles. These are just some of the deeds we should remember him for. While Lincoln’s words are everywhere maybe this statement that defines what the United States should be is his most lasting influence, “This is essentially a People's contest. On the side of the Union, it is a struggle for maintaining in the world, that form, and substance of government, whose leading object is, to elevate the condition of men---to lift artificial weights from all shoulders---to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all---to afford all, an unfettered start, and a fair chance, in the race of life. Yielding to partial, and temporary departures, from necessity, this is the leading object of the government for whose existence we contend.”

			<h1 id = "oba">President Obama</h1>
		<p >
			The economy President Obama inherited was in peril. When he took office in January of 2009, the United States was in the worst recession it had experienced since the Great Depression. Nearly 600,000 American workers lost their jobs in that month alone, and the unemployment rate was creeping up towards 8 percent (it would eventually top out at 10 percent that October).

			But by December 2016, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 178,000 jobs were created the previous month, bringing the unemployment rate to 4.6 percent, the lowest since August of 2007.
		<p></p>	
		In a 2015 research paper, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculated that the extraordinary measures the Obama administration took in the aftermath of the financial crisis, from stimulus spending to bailouts for insurance giant AIG, the financial and automotive industries, stemmed even greater losses in employment and GDP.

		It estimated that GDP would have declined by nearly 14 percent, and unemployment would have climbed to almost 16 percent (compared to 4 percent and just under 11 percent, respectively).

			<h1 id = "geo">President Washington</h1>
		<p >
		Washington was always the exemplar of republican virtue in America. He is seen more as a character model than war hero or founding father. One of Washington's greatest achievements, in terms of republican values, was refraining from taking more power than was due. He was conscientious of maintaining a good reputation by avoiding political intrigue. He had no interest in nepotism or cronyism, rejecting, for example, a military promotion during the war for his deserving cousin William Washington lest it be regarded as favoritism. Thomas Jefferson wrote, "The moderation and virtue of a single character probably prevented this Revolution from being closed, as most others have been, by a subversion of that liberty it was intended to establish." 
		<p></p>
		Although he sponsored and supported legislative proposals submitted to Congress for enactment, he carefully avoided trying to dictate or unduly influence the judicial and legislative branches of the government. In not vetoing bills with which he disagreed unless there were constitutional questions, he set a precedent of executive restraint that would be followed by the next five Presidents. Moreover, by keeping Vice President Adams at arm's length—not even inviting him to attend cabinet meetings—Washington set the tradition by which the vice president's role is largely ceremonial.

			<h1 id = "wil">President Wilson</h1>
		<p>
		Woodrow Wilson left the White House broken physically but serenely confident that his vision of America playing a central role in a league of nations would be realized eventually. While it can be argued that his stubbornness or his physical collapse prevented his realizing the dream that was within his grasp in 1919, there can be no doubt that his ideal inspired many Americans and that it shaped much of American foreign policy for the remainder of the twentieth century.
		<p></p>
		
		When legacy is defined as influence on the nation and future politics, Wilson ranks with Washington, Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt in importance. Richard Nixon recognized the power of Wilson's legacy when he returned Wilson's desk to the Oval Office in 1969. Nixon saw himself as the President who would establish a new, Wilsonian world order of stability and collective security to replace the Cold War confrontations of the 1950s and 1960s. That vision, of a world made safe and prosperous by the collective action of all nations, explains the enduring power of what former secretary of defense and head of the World Bank Robert McNamara called "Wilson's ghost." The spread of freedom and democracy, most Americans believe, would benefit everyone, and at the same time, a free, democratic world would be one in which the United States would be secure and American goods and services would be welcomed everywhere. The question of whether collective international action, such as Wilson advocated, or unilateral American policy will be most conducive to the creation of the sort of world Americans want is the basic foreign policy issue of the early twenty-first century, as it was of the early twentieth century.
