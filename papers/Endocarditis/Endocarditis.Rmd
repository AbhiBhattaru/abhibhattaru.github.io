\noindent
Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is an omnipresent commensal in the environment, studied for over a century. It is a zoonotic pathogen known to cause infections in animals and humans. Cases of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae in humans have been classified into three distinct entities: localized skin infections, diffuse skin infections, and systemic organ involvement. This particular pathogen is an uncommon cause of endocarditis, with an affinity for the aortic valve. We present a case of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae in a patient with involvement of the tricuspid valve.
