\noindent
In recent years, 18F-Sodium Fluoride (NaF)-PET/CT has seen its role in the detection and management of osteoporosis increase. This article reviews the extent of this application in the literature, its efficacy compared with other comparable imaging tools, and how total-body PET/CT combined with global disease assessment can revolutionize measurement of total osteoporotic disease activity. NaF-PET/CT eventually can be the modality of choice for metabolic bone disorders, especially with these advances in technology and computation.
